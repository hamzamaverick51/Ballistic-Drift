# Ballistic-Drift
Ballistic Drift is an arcade paddle game where you control a rounded paddle to volley a flaming, gradient ball against a CPU or friend. Each hit triggers flame and particle effects, screen shake, and ripples. Toggle flame trails, pick Easy/Medium/Hard AI, and track highscores saved between sessions.
